# BookShelf-App
This project is a simple and interactive bookshelf app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their book collection by adding new books, marking them as read or unread, and searching for books by title. The app uses localStorage to persist data, making it a lightweight and convenient tool for organizing your reading list.
